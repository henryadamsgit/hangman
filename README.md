Hangman Game

Hangman Game is a simple command-line game where players attempt to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of lives. This Java-based game provides an interactive and engaging experience for players of all ages.

How to Play
The game randomly selects a word from a predefined word list.
Players can choose their difficulty level, which determines the number of lives they have to guess the word:
Easy: 5 lives
Hard: 3 lives
Impossible: 1 life
The game displays the hidden word as a series of underscores, indicating the number of letters in the word.
Players enter a letter (a-z) to make a guess.
If the guessed letter is correct and exists in the word, the game reveals all occurrences of that letter in the hidden word.
If the guessed letter is incorrect, the player loses a life.
The game continues until the player guesses the entire word correctly or runs out of lives.
At the end of the game, the player receives a victory message if they guessed the word correctly. Otherwise, it's game over, and the hidden word is revealed.
